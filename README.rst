MINUIT from Python - Fitting like a boss

`iminuit` is a Python interface to the `MINUIT` C++ package.
It can be used as a general robust function minimisation method,
but is most commonly used for likelihood fits of models to data,
and to get model parameter error estimates from likelihood profile analysis.
